# Integrated Web Solutions for Language Together

## Introduction

Dative, Inc. has been privileged to work with Language Together on a series of interconnected projects aimed at enhancing their digital presence and providing innovative language learning solutions. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of these projects, detailing the objectives, technologies used, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.

### Overview of Dative's Collaboration with Language Together

Language Together is a platform dedicated to making language learning achievable for children. They utilize a unique method called the Spot Color Immersion MethodÂ® to teach vocabulary, phrases, and cultural lingo through 10-reader sets.

Dative, Inc. is a web development company that specializes in creating and managing websites that are easy to use and deliver results. Our collaboration with Language Together involved three main projects: the Language Together Website Migration, the Language Together Flashcard App, and the langt.co URL Shortener.

These projects were not only significant in their individual capacities but also as a collective effort to enhance Language Together's digital presence and user experience. Our collaboration was marked by a shared vision for innovative, user-friendly solutions that would make language learning more accessible and enjoyable for children.

### Interrelationship Between the Projects

The three projects were tightly coupled, each one supporting and enhancing the others.

- The Language Together Website Migration involved moving their existing website to a new server and performing updates. This migration laid the groundwork for the other projects, providing a stable and updated platform from which to launch the Flashcard App and the URL Shortener.
- The Language Together Flashcard App was a new product offering from Language Together. The website's CMS was modified to support this app, allowing customers to navigate flashcards online and listen to audio files.
- The langt.co URL Shortener was added to support both the Flashcard App and the website. It helped Language Together create short, manageable URLs for their marketing efforts, improving user experience and tracking capabilities.

In the following sections, we will delve into each project in more detail, exploring the goals, technologies used, infrastructure and architecture, roles and responsibilities, project roadmap, challenges and solutions, and ongoing maintenance and updates.

## 1. Language Together Website Migration

### 1.1 Project Overview

The Language Together Website Migration was the first project we embarked on with Language Together. The primary goal was to provide continued support for their existing website and overcome their inability to update the website due to server and development limitations.

We were able to migrate their existing Craft CMS website from Bluehost to a server better suited to run Craft, and perform some minor updates to the website. This migration was crucial as it laid the groundwork for the subsequent projects.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

The main objective of the project was to enhance the performance and reliability of the Language Together website. This involved:

- Migrating the website to a new server that is better suited to run Craft CMS.
- Overcoming server and development limitations that were preventing updates to the website.
- Performing minor updates to the website after the migration.

### 1.3 Technologies Used

The project utilized the following technologies:

- Craft CMS 2.9.2
- PHP 7.4.11
- MySQL 5.7.32
- Nginx 1.18.0

The server hosting Language Together's website was provisioned and managed using Laravel Forge. It was set up on a Digital Ocean Droplet located in Region New York 1, with an IP address of 157.230.179.54. The server is running a LEMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 as the operating system, and had 1 GB of Memory, 1 Intel CPU, and a 25 GB SSD as its hardware configuration. In terms of bandwidth, it has 1 TB Transfer per month.

### 1.4 Infrastructure and Architecture (with Diagram)

The infrastructure and architecture of the project involved a LEMP stack on a Digital Ocean Droplet. The server was provisioned and managed using Laravel Forge. The website was built using Craft CMS, which was hosted on the server.

### 1.5 Role and Responsibilities

As the primary developer for this project, Dative was responsible for:

- DevOps: Setting up and managing the server on Digital Ocean using Laravel Forge.
- Backend Development: Migrating the website and overcoming server and development limitations.
- Frontend Development: Performing minor updates to the website after the migration.
- Project Management: Coordinating the project and communicating with the client.

### 1.6 Project Roadmap

The project was divided into several stages:

- Initial Consultation: Understanding the client's needs and planning the migration.
- Setting Up the Server: Provisioning and managing the server using Laravel Forge.
- Migrating the Website: Transferring the website to the new server and overcoming server and development limitations.
- Testing / QA: Ensuring the website functions correctly on the new server.
- Finalizing Migration: Making the necessary DNS changes to point the domain to the new server.

### 1.7 Challenges and Solutions (with Context)

The main challenge was that the original Craft CMS website wasn't version controlled. We had to manually download the files and database from Bluehost, and then upload them to the new server. We also had to manually update the Craft CMS version to 2.9.2 as well as update the plugins.

The other challenge was that the website was using a custom plugin to manage the various content sections, instead of either built-in Craft CMS features or popular plugins. This made it difficult to migrate the content to the new server.

We overcame these challenges by creating a staging server to test the migration process, and then documenting the process so that we could repeat it on the production server.

Due to the lack on database migrations in Craft CMS 2, we've opt to update the update the production server directly using SSH instead of deploying changes using CI/CD.

### 1.8 Ongoing Maintenance and Updates

We are currently performing ongoing maintenance and updates on the website and the server. This includes regular updates to the Craft CMS and server software, as well as monitoring the server's performance and resolving any issues that arise.
